There is no single answer to the question &ldquo;How to study <span class="underline">\_</span>?&rdquo;&#x2014;everyone learns differently&#x2014;but here are some strategies that are generally helpful.
They are not specific to this course, and should be useful for studying mathematics in general.


# Reading

I am using &ldquo;reading&rdquo; as a short form form &ldquo;absorbing new mathematics&rdquo;.
It also applies to watching videos.

Read actively.
Pause often to think about what you have just read.
Reading maths is slow.
It is closer to reading poetry than reading a novel.
You need to think deeply about every sentence, and it is common for something to take a long time to sink in.

What to think while reading?
If you have read a definition, pause and try to construct examples yourself.
Also try to construct non-examples.
After that, create even more examples and non-examples.
Once you feel like you have a rich set of examples and non-examples, continue.
If the text gives some examples and non-examples, read them.
They will undoubtedly enrich your understanding.
If you feel like you do not have a rich set of examples, ask me (or someone else).

If you have read a statement (a proposition or a theorem), pause and try to find situations where the statement applies.
What does the statement say in this situation?
Does it say anything surprising?
Try to find other situations.
Also try to find situations where the statement does not apply.
Try to play devil&rsquo;s advocate by finding situations where the statement is wrong.
Assuming the statement is accurate, this will fail, but you will learn a lot from trying.

If you have read an explanation (a proof, for example), pause and try to find the key ideas in the explanation.
Try to find a concrete example where the explanation applies, and understand it in that example.
Then repeat with another example.


# Testing your understanding

Use the problems you see in lectures, workshops, quizzes, and homework to test your understanding.
After reading a problem, if

1.  you understand what exactly is being asked, and
2.  you can think of ways to get started,

then your understanding is good.  
It is not expected that you immediately see how to solve the problem.
But if you are stumped, or unable to get started, then your understanding is incomplete.
In this case, go back to the reading and revisit the related concepts.

Do not look at the solution to *any* problem without having spent sufficient time attempting it on your own.
If you do so, you are wasting a problem (and problems are valuable!).


# Approaching problems

It is not uncommon to feel stumped after reading a problem.
One reason is that you are not familiar with the relevant ideas.
But even if you are, it can be difficult to get started.
Here are some strategies to get started.

Your first attempt does not have to lead to a solution.
So try something and see if it leads anywhere.
A failed attempt will often generate new ideas.

The problem will often involve new terminology.
Break it down until you have restated it in terms you are familiar with.
As you get used to the new terminology, this process will get easier.

Experiment!
If the problem talks about a number $n$, experiment by taking small values of $n$.
If it talks about a graph, try with a some small examples of graphs.
If it talks about a function, test with some functions you know.
This is where it helps to have a handy collection of examples.

Try to find the corresponding simplest problem.
If the problem talks about a big number, try the same problem for smaller numbers.
If the problem talks about all graphs, try with some small graphs.
